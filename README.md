# PixInsightDoc

Source of unofficial PixInsight documentation, in PIDOC format, and support information to create a PixInsight update repository to release the documentation. The repository is at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitli/pixinsight-updates/main/

This documentation is not checked by Pleiades Astrophoto, all errors are mine. Use at your own risk. The documentation does not use non-public information nor copyrighted information except the source code, tool tips and some posts of Juan Conejero (with permission).

The documentation attempts to be factual.  When some remarks or recommendations of use  have been added, they are mine (based on information from the forum and own experience). They may not represent the opinion of Pleiades Astrophoto.

The announcement of updates is done in the forum at https://pixinsight.com/forum/index.php?threads/new-update-repository-with-user-contributed-documentation.23864/

You can use the PixInsight forum messages to contact me.  I invite corrections and constructive comments about
the content and the format.
When the documentations are reasonably complete in my opinion, I will propose them in the official GitLab repository. If an official document appears in the standard PixInsight distribution or if changes to the PixInsight process makes a document obsolete or misleading, I will remove them from the repository.

I make no commitment to be able to maintain the documentation or update it with a new release of PixInsight. This is done in my spare time. Each non official document is clearly labeled as such and shows the date/PixInsight version of the last release.
