# PixInsightDoc


Source of unoficial PixInsight documentation, in PIDOC format, and support for PixInsight update directory.

Ideally this documentation should be verified and distributed by the official GitLab repository,
but as this takes month or years, this parallel repository is used 
to provide early access to the document in a convenient form.
If official documentation becomes available during my life time, I will remove the corresponding documents.
